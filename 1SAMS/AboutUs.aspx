                         <p>Saket Gyanpeeth was established in the year 1994 with “GYANAM ANANTAM” as its motto. The main purpose of the trust is to render selfless service to the society through value based education. The noble concept of service to humanity: service to God has really inspired our founder Chairman Dr. Ram Ujagar Tiwari under whose guidance Saket Gyanpeeth is promoting better cause of education in Kalyan, Maharashtra and other remote area as well. The Trust provides medical facilities to needy and deserving persons by organizing camps from time to time and encourages all round development of the future generation by giving number of scholarships and free ships to brilliant and needy students.
In order to promote GYANAM ANANTAM, the trust started Saket Vidya Mandir English Primary School on 9th February 1998 and Saket Vidya Mandir English High School from academic year 2003- 04. </p><br />
